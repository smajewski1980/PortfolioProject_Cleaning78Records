        <p>
          A while ago I looked at various peoples' methods of cleaning their
          shellac 78rpm records. I used them all for inspiration in coming up
          with my own method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the 78s I acquire have been sitting around for decades and can
          be a bit dirty. I clean them the best I can before I catalog and file
          them. I do occasionally listen to some of them, but for the most part
          I collect them because they are old and I think they are cool.

        Here are the supplies I use. First and foremost I would like to give a
        shout-out to
        <a href="https://www.bagsunlimited.com" target="_blank"
          >Bags Unlimited</a
        >. It is a great place to buy supplies no matter what you collect. What
        I use from them is the gold kraft paper 10" sleeves and their microfiber
        cleaning cloths.

    <div class="section walmart">
      <p>
        I get a few things from Walmart that I treat as kind of disposable, such
        as cheap dish towels and dish drying mats. They are cheap enough that
        when they get soiled I just throw them away and use a new one. I also
        get the horse hair shoe brush from them, which is gentle enough to scrub
        the records without damaging them.

    <div class="section target">
      <img src="./images/dishRack.png" alt="drying rack" />
      <p>
        I wanted this style of dish rack for the records while they are drying,
        I like it because it's metal but has a rubbery coating. It took some
        hunting but I found this one at Target a while back.

    <div class="section ivory">
      <p>
        When I originally researched this topic, I saw multiple sources
        reccommend the clear Ivory dish soap because it doesn't have the
        additives that other soaps have. It also took some hunting to find.

          First I put on tunes to listen to while I work. Then I make my soap
          solution in a container. You only need a few drops of the Ivory soap.
          Here are my washing and drying stations.

      <div class="section wash">

            Next, I wet the brush, and starta scrubbin'. You will notice how
            more worn records kind of "absorb" the water where on a very good
            condition record the water will pool up on the top and roll around
            like water on a Rain-X treated windshield. I scrub in circular
            motions with the grooves.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section rinse">
        <p>
          While rinsing I have accidentally got the labels pretty wet a few
          times. While they seem to be fairly resilient, I try to keep the water
          away from them.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/rinse.png" alt="rinsing" />

      <div class="section drying">
        <div class="imgWrapper">
          <img class="image1" src="./images/drying1.png" alt="records drying" />
          <img class="image2" src="./images/drying2.png" alt="records drying" />
        </div>
        <p>
          After I rinse the record, I lay it flat on the dish drying mat and pat
          it down with the microfiber cloth. Sometimes I will wipe with the
          cloth in a circular motion with the grooves. If the label is dirty, I
          will wipe it gently with a damp paper towel and that usually does the
          trick. Then I place them in the dish rack to air dry the rest of the
          way.

        <p>
          And that's how I clean my shellac 78rpm records.<br /><br />As you saw
          in the picture at the top of the page, I place them all in the nice
          new sleeves from Bags Unlimited. Even if I have the original sleeve, I
          replace it. The paper that was used in the original sleeves seems to
          breakdown over time and some have a linty dust that I dont like. I do
          save them separately and have quite the collection.
